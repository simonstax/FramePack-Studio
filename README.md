# FramePack Studio

FramePack Studio is an enhanced version of the FramePack demo script, designed to create intricate video scenes with improved prompt adherence. This is very much a work in progress, expect some bugs and broken features.

## Current Features

- **F1 and Original FramePack Models**: Run both in a single queue
- **Timestamped Prompts**: Define different prompts for specific time segments in your video
- **Prompt Blending**: Define the blending time between timestamped prompts
- **Basic LoRA Support**: Works with most (all?) hunyuan LoRAs
- **Queue System**: Process multiple generation jobs without blocking the interface
- **Metadata Saving/Import**: Prompt and seed are encoded into the output PNG, all other generation metadata is saved in a JSON file
- **I2V and T2V**: Works with or without an input image to allow for more flexibility when working with standard LoRAs
- **Latent Image Options**: When using T2V you can generate based on a black, white, green screen or pure noise image


## Fresh Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- CUDA-compatible GPU with at least 8GB VRAM (16GB+ recommended)

### Setup

Install via the Pinokio community script "FP-Studio" or:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/colinurbs/FramePack-Studio.git
   cd FramePack-Studio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the studio interface:

```bash
python studio.py
```

Additional command line options:
- `--share`: Create a public Gradio link to share your interface
- `--server`: Specify the server address (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--port`: Specify a custom port
- `--inbrowser`: Automatically open the interface in your browser

## LoRAs

Add LoRAs to the /loras/ folder at the root of the installation. Select the LoRAs you wish to load and set the weights for each generation.

NOTE: there is currently a bug with LoRA unloading. Previously loaded LoRAs may impact future generations. Recommend restarting the app for now to be sure they're all unloaded from the model.

## Working with Timestamped Prompts

You can create videos with changing prompts over time using the following syntax:

```
[0s: A serene forest with sunlight filtering through the trees ]
[5s: A deer appears in the clearing ]
[10s: The deer drinks from a small stream ]
```

Each timestamp defines when that prompt should start influencing the generation. The system will (hopefully) smoothly transition between prompts for a cohesive video.
